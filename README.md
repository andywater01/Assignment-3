Z and R to undo and redo placing blocks

C to use the Dirty Flag optimization pattern to clear all blocks.

W A D to move/ jump

Click on the buttons to select a block and click again to place it.

If you right click on a block it will delete it.

I added updated sprites, a main menu, a clear scene functionality in the level editor

There is a UML Diagrom PNG in the repo
